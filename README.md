# OpenMC Notebook to Create a BWR fuel Assembly with a 3*3 Fuel-less Space at the Center
This SquareLattice-with-FuelLess-Square-at-Center.ipnyb file creates a square lattice with a square shaped gap and a _sleave_ around it.  

**The notebook has explanations of code inside.**

The final geometry will look like this.
